		This form is intended for patients who are claiming benefit under Special Rules for
		terminally ill people.
		It is not a claim form, as doctors cannot claim on behalf of their patients. The DS1500 asks for factual
		information and does not require you to give a prognosis.
		What we mean by terminally ill.
		In social security law someone is terminally ill if:
		l they are suffering from a progressive disease and, as a consequence of that disease
		l are not expected to live longer than 6 months.
		You should issue form DS1500 only if requested by patients (or their representatives) and you consider
		that the patient may be suffering from a potentially terminal illness.
		Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Attendance Allowance (AA) and Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
		Incapacity Benefit (IB)
		Under the Special Rules someone who is terminally ill can get DLA, AA or PIP:
		l even if they do not need help with looking after themselves
		l straight away.
		Their claim will be treated as urgent. When returning DS1500 forms to DWP, please ensure a separate envelope is
		used for each individual patient. Please do not staple documents together.
		Normally, people claiming IB can get the highest rate of benefit after 52 weeks of sickness. But someone who is terminally ill
		can get the highest rate of IB after 28 weeks of sickness, and will not normally be required to attend for medical examination.
		Patients who may not know the true nature of their illness
		When a patient asks you for a DS1500 Report, please do not assume that they know that they are terminally ill. They may
		not fully understand what the Special Rules are.
		For Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payment only any person
		representing the patient may make a 3rd party claim on their behalf, eve
